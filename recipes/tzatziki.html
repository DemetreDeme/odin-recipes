    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Did you know you can make restaurant-worthy tzatziki sauce in the comfort of your own home?</p>
    <p>Tzatziki is a refreshing cucumber-yogurt dip or sauce that comes together quickly with basic ingredients. The creamy sauce is a staple in Greek cuisine, where it is served in wraps like gyros and souvlaki, or simply on its own as a dip or side dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumbers: Start with two large cucumbers, grated and drained of excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Yogurt: Plain Greek yogurt is ideal for this tzatziki recipe.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: Choose a high-quality extra-virgin olive oil for the best flavor.</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs: This tzatziki sauce is flavored with minced garlic and fresh dill.</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: Lemon juice enhances the flavors of the other ingredients and adds a subtle brightness. You can also use red wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: The tzatziki is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the cucumbers: Peel and seed the cucumbers, then grate them with a box grater. Squeeze out the excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients: Mix the grated cucumber with the remaining ingredients. Stir until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Chill the tzatziki: For the best flavor, chill the tzatziki in the fridge for at least one hour before serving.</li>
        
    </ol>
